# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using supervised machine learning techniques.

# Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on their personal and travel attributes.

# Technologies / Libraries
- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- XGBoost  
- matplotlib, seaborn  

# Key Features
- Data cleaning and handling missing values  
- Feature engineering (e.g., family size, title extraction from names)  
- Implemented multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost  
- Evaluated models with accuracy and confusion matrix  

# Results
- Best Model: XGBoost  
- Accuracy: 86%  
- Confusion Matrix:  
   [[101 16]
     [ 9 53]]
